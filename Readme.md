# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project utilizes an artificial recurrent neural network, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to predict the closing stock price of a corporation based on the stock prices of the past 60 days.

## Features
- Predicts stock prices for different corporations such as Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL).
- Allows for customizable date ranges to analyze stock price data.
- Utilizes historical stock price data for training the LSTM model.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras
```

## Usage

You can specify the stock symbol and the date range to predict the stock prices. Below is an example configuration:

```python
stock = 'AAPL'  # You can change this to 'GOOGL' or other stock symbols
start_date = "01/06/21"  # Start date for historical data
end_date = "01/10/23"    # End date for historical data
```

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Collect historical stock price data for the specified stock and date range.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data by normalizing and structuring it for input into the LSTM model.
3. **Model Training**: Train the LSTM model using the preprocessed data.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the stock prices for the next day.
